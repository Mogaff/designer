Feature: AdBurst Factory (8-sec vertical ads generated from product stills using Veo 2, GPT-4o, ElevenLabs, FFmpeg, and Buffer)

üéØ Goal
Add a separate, self-contained "AdBurst Factory" feature into my existing Replit app as a completely new endpoint/functionality.
Important: Do not modify, delete, or alter existing functionalities or files.

üìå Implementation Steps:
Create a New, Independent Endpoint (/adburst):

Accepts exactly 3 image files uploaded via an HTML form or via a POST request.

Endpoint clearly named /adburst.

Backend Workflow (use Python/Node as per existing app):

Temporarily store uploaded images.

Use Zapier via a webhook or direct API calls to process images with:

Google Gemini Veo 2 API (for creating an 8-second video loop).

GPT-4o API (create short voice-over text + call-to-action).

ElevenLabs TTS API (generate audio from GPT-4o text).

FFmpeg (combine video and audio, then apply a subtle watermark).

Automatically upload the finished video to Buffer via Buffer‚Äôs API.

Output/Return to User:

Provide a downloadable link to the finished, watermarked MP4 video.

Clear error messages if any step fails.

‚ö†Ô∏è Strict Agent Rules (to avoid hallucinations/errors):
Do NOT:

Delete, alter, or overwrite existing files, routes, endpoints, variables, or functions.

Assume the existence of code that hasn't explicitly been verified in my current Replit environment.

Use placeholder keys, credentials, or fictional API endpoints.

Hallucinate API functionality: ONLY use the officially documented features of Google Gemini Veo 2, GPT-4o, ElevenLabs, FFmpeg, and Buffer.

DO:

Create clearly named, completely new files and folders if required (e.g., /adburst_factory/).

Explicitly document all newly introduced dependencies clearly in a separate text file called requirements_adburst.txt.

Clearly comment each step of the process within the code to explain precisely what each section is doing.

Include robust error handling for each API request, with helpful log messages.

üìë Required Output Files (generated by you):
/adburst_factory/adburst_endpoint.[js/py] ‚Äì contains ONLY the new functionality.

/adburst_factory/templates/adburst_form.html ‚Äì simple HTML form for uploading images (optional if API-only).

/adburst_factory/adburst_utils.[js/py] ‚Äì helper functions clearly separated and documented.

/adburst_factory/requirements_adburst.txt ‚Äì all new dependencies required for this functionality clearly listed.

Clear instructions for setting up API keys (Google Gemini Veo 2, GPT-4o, ElevenLabs, Buffer).

üß™ Testing & Validation:
Before finishing, briefly outline exactly how you‚Äôve tested or validated each part of this process.

Provide a clear checklist confirming no existing code was modified or deleted.

‚úÖ Final Confirmation:
Before completing, confirm explicitly:

"The AdBurst Factory feature was successfully added WITHOUT modifying, deleting, or affecting existing code. All dependencies and API keys are clearly documented."
