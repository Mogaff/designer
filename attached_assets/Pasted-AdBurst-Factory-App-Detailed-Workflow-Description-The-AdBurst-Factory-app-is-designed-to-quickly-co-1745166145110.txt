AdBurst Factory App: Detailed Workflow Description
The AdBurst Factory app is designed to quickly convert 3 uploaded product images into a professional-quality, 8-second vertical video advertisement, ready for TikTok, Instagram Reels, or similar platforms. It leverages a powerful chain of APIs and automated processes, ensuring the entire creation takes about 90 seconds from upload to finished video.

‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Workflow:
Step 1: User Image Upload
User selects exactly 3 product images from their device or drive.

Images are uploaded to your backend endpoint (/api/adburst) via:

A simple HTML/Tailwind frontend form (optional).

An API request from any frontend or backend client.

Step 2: Automatic Video Creation (Google Veo 2 API)
The backend immediately sends the first image to Google's Veo 2 API.

Veo 2 converts this static image into a dynamic 8-second vertical video (aspect ratio 9:16).

The video output showcases the product with gentle, dynamic camera movements or subtle zoom effects.

Step 3: Voiceover Text Generation (OpenAI GPT-4o)
Simultaneously, the backend calls OpenAI's GPT-4o API.

GPT-4o generates a short, catchy script for the ad‚Äîtypically one or two sentences, highlighting the product‚Äôs key benefits and including a clear call-to-action.

Step 4: Voiceover Audio Creation (ElevenLabs TTS API)
The GPT-generated text is sent immediately to ElevenLabs' TTS (Text-to-Speech) API.

ElevenLabs produces a high-quality, natural-sounding audio voiceover in MP3 format.

You may pre-select a specific voice style or allow future customization.

Step 5: Video & Audio Merging with Watermark (FFmpeg)
The backend downloads the generated video and voiceover audio.

Using FFmpeg (installed on your Replit backend), it merges:

The Veo 2 video file (visual)

The ElevenLabs audio file (audio)

A watermark/logo (watermark.png) added in the bottom-right corner

Result: a polished, final .mp4 file, ready for distribution.

Step 6: Automatic Upload & Scheduling (Buffer API)
After creating the final video, the backend automatically uploads it to Buffer:

Buffer handles scheduling/posting directly to TikTok, Instagram, etc.

This eliminates manual uploading and scheduling by the user.

Step 7: Final Output to User
Backend returns a clear success message and direct link to the uploaded Buffer video.

User can preview, download, or further manage via Buffer's interface.

üìö Technical Stack & APIs:
Frontend (optional HTML/Tailwind upload form)

Backend (Replit):

Google Gemini Veo 2 API (image-to-video, 8 sec, vertical)

OpenAI GPT-4o (ad script generation)

ElevenLabs TTS (voiceover audio synthesis)

FFmpeg (video/audio merging, watermarking)

Buffer API (automatic video upload and scheduling)

üí∂ Monetization & Costs:
Charge customers ‚Ç¨25 per individual video or ‚Ç¨149 for 10 videos/month.

API and GPU costs per generated ad remain extremely low (<‚ÄØ$0.15 per 8-second video from Veo 2).

üö® Important for Agent:
All new code files related to this feature are isolated in the dedicated folder /adburst_factory/.

Existing app code or functionality must never be modified or deleted.

Agent must always:

Clearly comment and document the new code.

Follow robust error handling and logging.
